        <p id="intro">
            Before I began the course I already learnt some html and css using the
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp.</a>
            This was work I did by myself and I found it easy to use.
        </p>

        <div class="learning-journal">
            <div>
                <header>
                    <h2>Week 1</h2>

                <p>Published on <time datetime="2023-10-08">8th October, 2023</time></p>
                <p>This week I learnt about putting a link to an email in a hyperlink and also how to upload my website
                    to brighton domains, these are things I haven't done before but I found this task easy.</p>
                <p>This is an image of my website so far as of 8th October:</p>
                <figure>
                    <div>
                        <img src="./images/week1Website.png" alt="my website so far">
                        <figcaption>My Website So Far</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    As for progress on my website I created a header, added hyperlinks that link to the other pages on
                    my
                    website,
                    talked a bit about my learning and added an image. In the css I added a border to my image which I
                    had
                    learnt how to do from FreeCodeCamp, I also added width 100% which will make the image responsive.
                </p>
                <p>I don't think I will learn anything much from doing this coursework since I have already studied web
                    design before, but I hope to be proved wrong.</p>

                <p>
                    This week I set up git with my website. What git will do is keep track of all the different versions
                    of
                    my files.
                    This means that if I make a change and it breaks my website I can always go back to a previous
                    version
                    where my website works.
                    I have found git very useful in the past when I was making an etch a sketch website and the page
                    would
                    freeze after using it for a while.
                    I had to go back to a previous version where the page wouldn't freeze and figure out the issue from
                    there.
                </p>

            <div>
                <header>
                    <h2>Week 3</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Published on <time datetime="2023-08-24">24th October, 2023</time></p>

                <p>This week I added a table to my learning journal that showed the time schedule I followed when
                    creating my website.
                    I had created a table previously but I still had to do a recap over it since I had forgotten parts.
                    This time I had to learn how to make my table responsive, I did this by following a
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czZ1PvNW5hk" target="_blank">youtube tutorial by Kevin
                        Powell.</a>
                    This puts a horizontal scroll bar on the table,
                    if I didn't do this there would be a horizontal scrollbar on the whole page which isn't ideal.
                    Since it's a small table I thought that this solution was perfect since mobile devices would
                    primarily
                    be the ones encountering this issue.
                    Mobile devices are touchscreen so all a user would need to do is swipe to the side, so a it isn't a
                    problem for them.

                <p>Besides the lab session on tuesday I just do the work whenever I felt like it and there was no
                    schedule,
                    I feel like I work best like this
                    and at the moment I don't need to set aside specific times.
                </p>

                <p>After this I used css to add borders, centre the text and add padding. I originally learnt how to
                    do this on an
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics" target="_blank">mdn
                        tutorial
                        for table basics.</a>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="colorBg">

                    <h2>Week 4</h2>
                </header>

                <p>It is currently the 3rd November</p>
                <p>This week I have styled my website, I added a striped
                    pattern in the weeks in my blog where Week 1 will have a white background then week 2 grey and week
                    3 white and so on. I created a new header to my page that has a blue background. I also added
                    padding to the sides of my page and line height that make the text easier to read since it's closer
                    to the centre of the page and has more space between the lines.</p>
                <p>Here is a before and after comparison of my website:</p>

                <div>
                    <img src="./images/beforeCss.png" alt="My website before I added css">
                    <img src="./images/afterCss.png" alt="My website after I added css">
                </div>

                <p>Another thing I did this week was update my table, last week I was creating a table to show the
                    schedule I followed when creating my website but since I only did work on it in the lab and whenever
                    I felt like it a table was not the best method to display the information. I decided to make the
                    table display my whole univeristy timetable but I ran into a problem when some lessons started at
                    half past the hour and my table wasn't designed for this. I knew I could just create more time slots
                    on my table to include half past the hour but I didn't like this solution since it seemed like a lot
                    of work. After looking for a solution I couldn't find one so I just did what I originally thought
                    of.</p>
                <p>Here is the before and after:</p>
                <div>
                    <img src="./images/oldTable.png" alt="Table before I updated it">
                    <img src="./images/newTable.png" alt="Table after I updated it">
                </div>

            </div>
            <div>

                    <h2>Week 5</h2>
                </header>

                <p>7th November</p>
                <p>This week I added a font family value of 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif to my css.
                    If a user doesn't have the Segoe UI font it will fallback to tahoma and so on until it uses the
                    users browsers default font.</p>
