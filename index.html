        Before I began the course I already learnt some html and css using the
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp.</a>
        This was work I did by myself and I found it easy to use.

            <p>This week I learnt about putting a link to an email in a hyperlink and also how to upload my website to brighton
                domains, these are things I haven't done before but I found this task easy.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                As for progress on my website I created a header, added hyperlinks that link to the other pages on my website,
                talked a bit about my learning and added an image
            </p>
            <p>I don't think I will learn anything much from doing this coursework since I have already studied web design before, but I hope to be proved wrong.</p>

            <p>
                This week I set up git with my website. What git will do is keep track of all the different versions of my files.
                This means that if I make a change and it breaks my website I can always go back to a previous version where my website works. 
                I have found git very useful in the past when I was making an etch a sketch website and the page would freeze after using it for a while. 
                I had to go back to a previous version where the page wouldn't freeze and figure out the issue from there.
