        <p>
            Before I began the course I already learnt some html and css using the
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp.</a>
            This was work I did by myself and I found it easy to use.

            <p>This week I learnt about putting a link to an email in a hyperlink and also how to upload my website to
                brighton
                domains, these are things I haven't done before but I found this task easy.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./images/week1Website.png" alt="my website so far">
                <figcaption>My Website So Far</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As for progress on my website I created a header, added hyperlinks that link to the other pages on my
                website,
                talked a bit about my learning and added an image. In the css I added a border to my image which I had
                learnt how to do from FreeCodeCamp.
            </p>
            <p>I don't think I will learn anything much from doing this coursework since I have already studied web
                design before, but I hope to be proved wrong.</p>

            <p>
                This week I set up git with my website. What git will do is keep track of all the different versions of
                my files.
                This means that if I make a change and it breaks my website I can always go back to a previous version
                where my website works.
                I have found git very useful in the past when I was making an etch a sketch website and the page would
                freeze after using it for a while.
                I had to go back to a previous version where the page wouldn't freeze and figure out the issue from
                there.
            </p>

            <p>This week I added a table to my learning journal that showed the time schedule I followed when creating
                my website.
                I had created a table previously but I still had to do a recap over it since I had forgotten parts.
                This time I had to learn how to make my table responsive, I did this by following a
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czZ1PvNW5hk" target="_blank">youtube tutorial by Kevin
                    Powell.</a>
                This puts a horizontal scroll bar on the table,
                if I didn't do this there would be a horizontal scrollbar on the whole page which isn't ideal.
                Since it's a small table I thought that this solution was perfect since mobile devices would primarily
                be the ones encountering this issue.
                Mobile devices are touchscreen so all a user would need to do is swipe to the side, so a it isn't a
                problem for them.

            <p>Besides the lab session on tuesday I just do the work whenever I felt like it and there was no schedule,
                I feel like I work best like this
                and at the moment I don't need to set aside specific times.
            </p>

            <p>After this I used css to add borders, centre the text and add padding. I originally learnt how to
                do this on an
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics" target="_blank">mdn tutorial
                    for table basics.</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Week 4</h3>

            <p>It is currently the 3rd November</p>
            <p>This week I have decided to style my website, I think a good look for this will be having a striped
                pattern in the weeks in my blog.
                Week 1 will have a white background then week 2 grey and week 3 white and so on.</p>
