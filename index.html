            Before I began the course I already learnt some html and css using the
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreeCodeCamp.</a>
            This was work I did by myself and I found it easy to use.

                <p>This week I learnt about putting a link to an email in a hyperlink and also how to upload my website
                    to brighton domains, these are things I haven't done before but I found this task easy.</p>
                    <p>This is an image of my website so far as of 8th October:</p>

                        <img src="./images/week1Website.png" alt="my website so far">
                        <figcaption>My Website So Far</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    As for progress on my website I created a header, added hyperlinks that link to the other pages on
                    my
                    website,
                    talked a bit about my learning and added an image. In the css I added a border to my image which I
                    had
                    learnt how to do from FreeCodeCamp.
                </p>
                <p>I don't think I will learn anything much from doing this coursework since I have already studied web
                    design before, but I hope to be proved wrong.</p>

                <p>
                    This week I set up git with my website. What git will do is keep track of all the different versions
                    of
                    my files.
                    This means that if I make a change and it breaks my website I can always go back to a previous
                    version
                    where my website works.
                    I have found git very useful in the past when I was making an etch a sketch website and the page
                    would
                    freeze after using it for a while.
                    I had to go back to a previous version where the page wouldn't freeze and figure out the issue from
                    there.
                </p>

            <div>

                <p>This week I added a table to my learning journal that showed the time schedule I followed when
                    creating
                    my website.
                    I had created a table previously but I still had to do a recap over it since I had forgotten parts.
                    This time I had to learn how to make my table responsive, I did this by following a
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czZ1PvNW5hk" target="_blank">youtube tutorial by Kevin
                        Powell.</a>
                    This puts a horizontal scroll bar on the table,
                    if I didn't do this there would be a horizontal scrollbar on the whole page which isn't ideal.
                    Since it's a small table I thought that this solution was perfect since mobile devices would
                    primarily
                    be the ones encountering this issue.
                    Mobile devices are touchscreen so all a user would need to do is swipe to the side, so a it isn't a
                    problem for them.

                <p>Besides the lab session on tuesday I just do the work whenever I felt like it and there was no
                    schedule,
                    I feel like I work best like this
                    and at the moment I don't need to set aside specific times.
                </p>

                <p>After this I used css to add borders, centre the text and add padding. I originally learnt how to
                    do this on an

                <p>It is currently the 3rd November</p>
                <p>This week I have decided to style my website, I think a good look for this will be having a striped
                    pattern in the weeks in my blog.
                    Week 1 will have a white background then week 2 grey and week 3 white and so on.</p>
