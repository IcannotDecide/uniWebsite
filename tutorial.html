        <p>One thing I have learnt and improved upon is my mindset. I used to procrastinate tasks such as coursework and
            studying because I always thought "why do it now when I can do it later and have fun now." This wasn't a
            good strategy because the work I had to do was always in the back of my mind which stressed me out and
            impacted by ability to enjoy things, it also meant that I rushed all my work right before the deadline so my
            work wouldn't be the best it could be. The first step to change was realising that this was a problem. I
            realised that the negatives far outweigh the positives and if I just did my work instead of putting it off I
            would be better off. This has made my mindset better because instead of thinking "Why do it now when I can
            do it later and have fun now" I open my work and try to do it. There are still things to work on, I find it
            hard to focus on my work when the deadline isn't right there but I still make a bit of progress which is
            better than nothing. In the future I can try and work on my focus.</p>
