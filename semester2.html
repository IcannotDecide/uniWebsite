    <h3>What is meant by compiled and interpreted languages?</h3>
    <p>Compiled languages are converted into machine code then ran by the CPU whereas interpreted languages are ran line
        by line without the need for them to be compiled. Javascript is an interpreted language.</p>

    <h3>What is meant by weakly and strongly typed languages</h3>
    <p>Strongly typed languages have stricter typing rules which means it is more likely to run into errors when the
        code is ran or compiled. Weakly typed languages have looser rules which can produce unpredictable results.
        Javascript is weakly typed.</p>

    <h3>Three common uses for JavaScript in web development</h3>
    <p>JavaScript can be used to provide extra functionality to parts of a webpage. For example if a user clicks on text
        you can make that text change colour or run an animation.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another use for JavaScript in web development is adding more html to a page in real time. This is useful for
        example if a user fills out a form and you want to display the results of that form on the page you can add that
        to the page using JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another use of JavaScript in web development is to connect to servers</p>
